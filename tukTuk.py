     - servicesFileName is a str with the name of a .txt file containing a list of services organized as in the examples provided;
     - reservationsFileName is a str with the name of a .txt file containing a list of reserved services organized as in the examples provided;
     - the files whose names are driversFileName, vehiclesFileName, servicesFileName and reservationsFileName concern the same company and the same day;
     - the file whose name is reservationsFileName concerns the period indicated by nextPeriod;
     - the files whose names are driversFileName, vehiclesFileName, servicesFileName concern the period immediately preceding the period indicated by nextPeriod;
     - the file name reservationsFileName ends (before the .txt extension) with the string nextPeriod;
